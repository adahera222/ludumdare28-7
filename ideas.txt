You are a squirrel in a forest running away from dogs
also the humans are burning the forest because they are playing for sport and are hurting the environment


Enemy types:
    dogs - chase you
    fire - blocks, kills you if you walk into it, spreads slowly, has low chance of burning out each tick

spreading fire

you only get one powerup per level - makes you faster, can run through fires and enemies

Powerups:
    superspeed
    invincibility
    make everything scared of you
    increased pickup radius?
    

the level ends when there are no more acorns

you can use one of several powerups once per level



todo:
    activate powerup


    make trees and stumps sad when they catch on fire and make them look charcoaled

    make an intruction screen

    make the player invincible for a few seconds on spawn

    juice for getting more acorns


    -if you hold a key while dying you don't go back to the middle

    -make fewer acorns

    -add sound effects
    -add bgm




    -add transitions
    -fix firefox

    -add wasd

    -level changing

    -have fires burn acorns
    -have fires kill playern
    -have fires spread and burn out with very low chance


    -make dog enemy that chases you

    -pathfinding use astar.js

    -human laying fire
    -make the ground grass instead of doritos

    -game over screen where it shows the total number of acorns you got

    -start with 3 lives and get another one after 1000 acorns


    -acorns are happy when you are near and sad when enemies are near

    -acorns look at the entity closest to them, not just the player

    disallow fires from going outside the map
