You are a squirrel in a forest running away from dogs
also the humans are burning the forest because they are playing for sport and are hurting the environment


Enemy types:
    dogs - chase you
    fire - blocks, kills you if you walk into it, spreads slowly, has low chance of burning out each tick

spreading fire

you only get one powerup per level - makes you faster, can run through fires and enemies

Powerups:
    superspeed
    invincibility
    make everything scared of you
    increased pickup radius?
    

the level ends when there are no more acorns

you can use one of several powerups once per level



todo:
    activate powerup
    -have fires burn acorns
    -have fires kill player
    -have fires spread and burn out with very low chance

    level changing

    make dog enemy that chases you and avoid fires

    -pathfinding use astar.js

    human laying fire
    make the ground grass instead of doritos

    -game over screen where it shows the total number of acorns you got

    start with 3 lives and get another one after 1000 acorns

    fix the controls so that it prefers the opposite of the previous direction

    acorns are happy when you are near and sad when enemies are near

    acorns blinking at random
    acorns look at the entity closest to them, not just the player

    if you hold a key while dying you don't go back to the middle

    make the acorns animate when they catch fire (same with the trees)

    gust of wind with leaves showing where fire will spread

    add lightning strikes for adding fire
